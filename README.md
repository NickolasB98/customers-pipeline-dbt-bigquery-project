**DBT and BigQuery: A Powerful Duo for Modern Data Engineering**

This project demonstrates a practical use case for combining DBT (Data Build Tool) and Google BigQuery for data transformation and warehousing.
BigQuery is then connected to Google Looker Studio for BI Visualization.

**Introduction**

In today's data-driven world, DBT and BigQuery have become essential tools for data engineers and analysts. DBT simplifies data transformation with its SQL-based approach, while BigQuery offers a powerful and scalable data warehouse. Together, they provide a streamlined workflow for managing data pipelines.

**Key Features**

##### DBT:

SQL-based transformations (familiar language for data professionals)
Version control with Git for code management
Built-in testing capabilities for data quality assurance
Automatic documentation generation for data models

##### BigQuery:

Serverless architecture eliminates infrastructure management needs
Real-time analytics for up-to-date data insights
Automatic backups and easy data restores
Seamless integration with other Google Cloud services

**Workflow Overview**

Extract: Data is retrieved from various sources and loaded into BigQuery.
Transform with DBT: SQL-based transformations are written and tested within DBT, executing directly in BigQuery.
Load: Transformed data resides in BigQuery, ready for analysis.
Analyze: Any BI tool can be used to analyze the prepared data.
Benefits:

Scalability: Both DBT and BigQuery handle large datasets effectively.
Maintainability: DBT's version control and testing ensure transformation accuracy.
Cost-Effectiveness: DBT is open-source, and BigQuery offers a pay-as-you-go model.
Speed: DBT leverages BigQuery's power for fast data processing.
Getting Started

Set up a Google Cloud Account: Create a GCP account and a BigQuery dataset.
Install DBT: Install DBT and configure it to connect to your BigQuery instance.
Develop DBT Models: Write your DBT models and tests.
Run DBT Transformations: Execute DBT transformations and tests against your BigQuery dataset.
Detailed Instructions

**Setting Up BigQuery:**

GCP Account: Sign up for a free GCP account with a $300 credit.
Create a Project: In the GCP Console, navigate to the dashboard and create a new project.
Enable BigQuery API: In the GCP Console, locate and enable the BigQuery API.
Access BigQuery Console: Access the BigQuery console directly from the GCP dashboard.
Create a Service Account: Create a service account with Owner role in your project and download its private key for DBT connection.
Setting Up DBT:

Install DBT: Use pip install dbt-core dbt-bigquery to install DBT with the BigQuery adapter.
Create a DBT Project: Run dbt init dbt_bigquery to initialize a DBT project.
Verify Connection: Run dbt debug to verify the connection between DBT and BigQuery.
Run DBT Setup: Execute dbt run to run your DBT project.
Troubleshooting:

If you encounter the error "DBT: Package names must be unique," refer to the provided Stack Overflow link for resolution.

**Expected Output:**

Upon successful execution of dbt run, you should see your models populated within your BigQuery dataset.

**Using Multiple Datasets**

The instructions demonstrate adding a custom dataset (dbt-tutorial) and creating a new model (customer_orders.sql) to showcase working with multiple datasets.

**Querying Output on BigQuery**

Use the BigQuery console to query the output data. The example query provided retrieves the first 1000 rows from the customer_orders table within your dataset.

**Connecting Looker Studio to BigQuery:**

Sign in to Looker Studio (https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-studio-now-available-as-a-google-cloud-service).
Click "Create" and select "Data Source."
Choose "BigQuery" as the data source type.
Select your project and dataset containing the transformed data from your DBT models.
Click "Connect."

Data Visualization in Looker Studio:

Once connected, explore your data tables in Looker Studio.
Drag and drop fields to create charts and visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts, tables).
Use filters and drill-downs to analyze specific data segments.
Share your reports and dashboards with collaborators for better decision-making.

**Conclusion**

This project showcases a powerful combination of DBT, BigQuery, and Looker Studio for a complete data transformation, warehousing, and visualization workflow. By leveraging these tools, you can transform raw data into actionable insights that drive informed business decisions.
